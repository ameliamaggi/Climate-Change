## **Introduction**
Climate change is a massive concern in the modern world, and it is greatly attributed to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Abbass et al. 2022). Transportation is a major influence on GHG emissions as most vehicles can only operate thanks to the burning of fossil fuels (Pal et al. 2023; US EPA 2015). Walkable and transit-friendly cities help to reduce the emissions of passenger vehicles and are thus the crux of this proposal (The Climate Reality Project 2021; Li et al. 2025). 
## **Proposal**
In the search to mitigate the issue of climate change in the context of GHG emission from transportation, more specifically on private car dependency, the idea of walkable cities was proposed. The concept of walkability considers the implementation of walking /cycling infrastructure and the endorsement of public transit systems. Introducing walkability as a framework for urban planning initiatives is not only beneficial for the environment but in other societal aspects as well (Carter et al. 2015). For example, a study done in 2024 by Community Climate Change Action Plan found that transportation accounted for approximately 19% of Hamilton’s total GHG emissions, essentially making the progress towards active and low-carbon goals, which is critical for abiding to climate change objectives (Figure 1) (BuildAbility Corporation 2024.).

Sedentary lifestyles are on the rise due to the convenience that urbanization has brought along such as remote jobs, food delivery services, and online shopping (Park et al. 2020). The reliance that society has on private vehicle, supports healthier communities overall. While the advantages of walkable cities are apparent, it is important to note that there are certain disadvantages that comes with implementation of cost- extensive projects on a large scale (Benassi and De Falco 2025). 
## **Counterarguments**
Pedestrian walking decisions are substantially influenced by numerous factors, one of them being thermal comfort. Extreme temperatures associated with climate change confronts walkability and safety through affecting pedestrian’s thermal comfort (Baobeid et al., 2021). Thermal discomfort diminishes walking and cycling while enhancing vehicle use, contributing to increased GHG emission. Increased air pollution tends to be coupled with high walkability, unequally impacting low-income communities (Marshall et al., 2009). Furthermore, walkable design may not accommodate people with disabilities, leading to inequitable access, raising demands for barrier-free infrastructures (Southworth, 2005). 
## **Feasibility**
The feasibility of effective global implementation of transit-oriented development (TOD) and the transition to walkable, low transit cities varies between low-income and high-income regions (Mirmoghtadaee 2016). High-income contexts face barriers such as fragmented planning, hindering optimal project design and placement near transit, internal financial restrictions, and a car-centric culture. Low-income contexts face barriers such as fragmented governance, preventing policy action, and a lack of structured financial mechanisms (Ling et al. 2025; Hrelja et al. 2022; Nadeem and Matsuyuki 2025). The recommended process for high-income regions to overcome these challenges involves coordinated transit and land-use planning, implementing land-value capture models through selling the land made economically valuable by the new transit system, and subsequently using the revenue to finance micro-scale retrofitting (Kjeldsen and Joseph 2025; Wei and Mogharabi 2013; van Zoest and Daamen 2024; Fayed et al. 2020). For low-income regions the process involves prioritizing government stability to secure incremental financial investment support and ensuring for legal land ownership (Abbasi 2025; Dehghan et al. 2024; Bahaelu Horeh 2025). Following these processes in both regional contexts allows for effective and successful TOD.
